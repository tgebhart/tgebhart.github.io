My research is focused on the study of complex systems through a topological lens.
These complex systems are often naturally characterized by a network. The
interaction between the topological structure of the network and functional properties
of the processes which exist on or are described by the network are often linked.
An understanding of the interaction between the topology and function of complex
systems provides a foothold for understanding their fundamental pieces, composing
these pieces to create more complex behaviors, and augmenting the behavior of these
systems for greater societal benefit.

Topological Data Analysis (TDA) is a relatively new applied-mathematical
field whose methods are derived from the much older field of algebraic topology.
TDA is concerned with characterizing the “shape” of spaces in an invariant manner.
Work in the past two decades have brought theory from algebraic topology into the
data sciences by discretizing traditional topological concepts. With this
discretization comes powerful methods for tracking local-to-global structural
properties within high-dimensional data. My research borrows many methods from
TDA, including persistent homology, combinatorial Hodge theory, and the theory of
cellular sheaves.

Social sciences like Economics and Sociology of Science are frequently faced with 
processes defined on networks. For example, production shocks to sectors of the economy may 
be approximated by the topology of the network of producer-supplier relationships.  
The propagation of beliefs in a community is often modeled as a form of heat diffusion across 
the community's social network. Metrics of scientific and technological disruption are 
derived from the network of citations among scientific articles. Many models of 
social phenomena have a network structure at their core. My research seeks to improve and 
further expand the breadth of tractable social phenomena.

The connectivity structure of deep neural networks plays a dominant role in their
function. However, due to the large and complicated nature of these networks,
little is understood about the relationship between neural network structure and
function. I am interested in how semantic knowledge about a domain is encoded in 
the parameter connectivity of these models. The successful implicit biases embedded
within networks due to their architectural specifications and initialization methods can 
provide insight into the high-dimensional structure present in the data used to train the network.
An understanding of these biases can also help point us towards network architectures
that are better suited for particular tasks that will train more quickly, require less
data, and generalize to unseen data in more expected ways.
