I am a computer scientist, applied mathematician, and a Ph.D. candidate at the University of Minnesota, Department of Computer Science. My research is focused on the application of ideas from topology and category theory to a range of multi-disciplinary problems. I am interested in the general class of problems regarding the characterization of computations that exist on or are parameterized by networks. Of particular interest are neural networks, knowledge networks, and other complex systems. My hope is that by applying mathematical tools with the proper level of abstraction, we can better probe representations embedded in complex networks, allowing for more structured data science, explainable AI, and further insight into the structure of knowledge.
